# Unsupervised-Stool-Sample-Analysis-in-Hepatic-Encephalopathy

Broad Problem Statement
Liver cirrhosis is a condition where a patient’s liver is damaged. This damage is permanent and if severe enough can make a transplant the only treatment option [1]. Along with damage to the liver, some cirrhosis patients have an accumulation of toxins in the brain known as hepatic encephalopathy (referred to as HE) [2]. Researchers are trying to determine the relationship between the condition of the digestive system and HE. In this project, the relationship between the microbial composition of the digestive tract and HE was investigated.

Concepts learned and applied in this project

- Bayesian Networks
- Statistical analysis (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Multiple testing, Q-Q plot)
